Example Drupal 8 Sample Content Migration

Using this example module and some commands to work with migrations from either
[Migrate Run](https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_run) or [Migrate Tools](https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_tools)
you can import some hard-coded sample content with no other code.
